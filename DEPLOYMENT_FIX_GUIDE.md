# Hotel TV Management System - Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Summary
The backend application was crashing immediately after startup due to a **Redis configuration incompatibility**. The application was using Redis client v4.x but with an outdated configuration format.

## Root Cause
- Redis client v4+ requires a different connection configuration format
- The old format used separate `host` and `port` parameters
- The new format requires a `url` parameter
- Additionally, multer package was using a deprecated version

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Redis Configuration (`backend/src/config/redis.js`)
- ‚úÖ Updated to use Redis v4+ compatible configuration
- ‚úÖ Changed from `{host, port}` to `{url: 'redis://host:port'}`
- ‚úÖ Improved reconnection strategy and error handling
- ‚úÖ Added better event logging

### 2. Updated Dependencies (`backend/package.json`)
- ‚úÖ Updated multer from `^1.4.5-lts.1` to `^2.0.0` to remove deprecation warnings
- ‚úÖ All other dependencies remain compatible

### 3. Enhanced Server Startup (`backend/server.js`)
- ‚úÖ Added detailed startup logging for better diagnostics
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling with specific error identification
- ‚úÖ Added graceful shutdown handling
- ‚úÖ Better step-by-step initialization process

### 4. Added Verification Tools
- ‚úÖ Created `verify-fix.js` script to test connections before deployment

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push Changes to Repository
```bash
# In your local development directory
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Redis connection and startup issues"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Pull Changes on Server
```bash
# SSH to your server
ssh root@155.138.231.215

# Navigate to application directory
cd /var/www/hotel-tv-management

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main
```

### Step 3: Install Updated Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Install updated dependencies (including multer v2)
npm install
```

### Step 4: Verify Configuration (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# Go back to root directory
cd ..

# Run verification script
node verify-fix.js
```

Expected output if everything is working:
```
üöÄ Hotel TV Management System - Fix Verification

üîç Testing Redis connection with new configuration...
Connecting to: redis://localhost:6379
‚úÖ Redis client connected
‚úÖ Redis ping successful: PONG
‚úÖ Redis set/get test successful: test_value
‚úÖ Redis connection test completed successfully
üîç Testing database connection...
‚úÖ Database connection test successful

üìä Verification Results:
Redis: ‚úÖ PASS
Database: ‚úÖ PASS

üéâ All tests passed! The application should start successfully.
```

### Step 5: Restart Application
```bash
# Stop the current errored process
pm2 delete hotel-tv-backend

# Start fresh (this will use the updated code)
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

# Check status
pm2 status
```

### Step 6: Monitor Logs
```bash
# Watch real-time logs
pm2 logs hotel-tv-backend

# Or check specific log files
tail -f logs/combined.log
tail -f logs/error.log
```

Expected successful startup logs:
```
info: Starting Hotel TV Management System...
info: Environment: production
info: Host: 155.138.231.215, Port: 3000
info: Connecting to database...
info: Database connected successfully
info: Connecting to Redis...
info: Redis connected successfully
info: Starting HTTP server...
info: ‚úÖ Server running on http://155.138.231.215:3000
info: Initializing WebSocket server...
info: WebSocket server initialized
info: Initializing PMS service...
info: PMS service initialized
info: Starting scheduler service...
info: Scheduler service started
info: üöÄ Hotel TV Management System started successfully!
```

### Step 7: Test Application
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"OK","timestamp":"2025-07-24T...","uptime":...,"version":"1.0.0"}
```

### Step 8: Access Web Interface
Open your browser and navigate to:
- http://155.138.231.215

You should see the Hotel TV Management System login page.

## Troubleshooting

### If Redis Still Fails
```bash
# Check if Redis is running
systemctl status redis-server

# Start Redis if not running
systemctl start redis-server

# Test Redis manually
redis-cli ping
```

### If Database Fails
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL status
systemctl status postgresql

# Test database connection
sudo -u postgres psql -d hotel_tv_management -c "SELECT NOW();"
```

### If Port is in Use
```bash
# Check what's using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill any conflicting processes
pm2 kill
```

### Check Environment Variables
```bash
# View the .env file to ensure all variables are set
cat backend/.env

# Key variables that must be present:
# - DB_PASSWORD (should be the generated password from deployment)
# - JWT_SECRET (should be the generated secret)
# - SERVER_HOST=155.138.231.215
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Code changes pulled to server
- [ ] Dependencies updated (`npm install` completed)
- [ ] Redis connection test passes
- [ ] Database connection test passes
- [ ] PM2 process shows `online` status
- [ ] No error logs in `pm2 logs`
- [ ] Health endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] Web interface loads properly

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
1. ‚úÖ Application starts successfully without crashes
2. ‚úÖ PM2 shows stable "online" status instead of "errored"
3. ‚úÖ No more "too many unstable restarts" errors
4. ‚úÖ Web interface loads and is accessible
5. ‚úÖ Admin can complete hotel setup process
6. ‚úÖ All backend services (WebSocket, PMS sync, scheduler) work properly

## Contact

If you encounter any issues during deployment, please check:
1. The PM2 logs: `pm2 logs hotel-tv-backend`
2. The application logs: `tail -f /var/www/hotel-tv-management/logs/error.log`
3. System logs: `journalctl -u pm2-root.service -f`

The main fixes address the Redis connection incompatibility which was the root cause of the startup crashes.
